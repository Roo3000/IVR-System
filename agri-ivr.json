Use Resistant Varieties:\nPlant cassava varieties that are resistant to common pests to minimize damage.\n3. Employ Biological Control Agents:\nIntroduce natural enemies of pests like beneficial insects or microbial agents to control pest populations.\n4. Targeted Use of Chemical Pesticides:\nAs a last resort, apply chemical pesticides selectively and according to recommended guidelines to minimize environmental impact.\n\nDisease Management for Cassava:\n1. Field Sanitation:\nKeep the field clean by removing crop residues and weeds that can harbor disease-causing organisms.\n2.Use Disease-Free Planting Materials:\nStart with healthy planting materials to prevent the introduction of diseases into the field.\n3. Apply Approved Fungicides:\nUse fungicides when necessary to control fungal diseases, following recommended application rates and schedules.\n4. Remove Infected Plants:\nPromptly remove and destroy plants showing signs of disease to prevent the spread of pathogens.\n\nBy integrating these strategies into your cassava farming practices, you can effectively manage pests and diseases, ensuring healthier crops and higher yields.",
